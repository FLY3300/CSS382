# search
Question 1: 
This first question is slove using Depth First Search (DFS), in this problem, we used stack. 
In the code, it first initialize the stack with start sate and it has a empty set to store the states thats being visited. It then have a while loop to check and run the code while stack is not empty. In the while loop, we will pop the state, which is the node and move from the stack and if the goal state is met, we would return the moves, which is the answer to this problem. Else it would continue visiting the path from the current node. We than have the for loop to expore all the successor and check if there is any node that hasn't been visit yet, if so, it would add it to the stack for the next visit. 

Question 2:
In this question, a queue is being used to slove for BFS
